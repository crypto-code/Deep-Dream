# Deep-Dream
Find and Enhance Patterns in Images via Algorithmic Pareidolia

## What is Deep Dream ?

DeepDream is a computer vision program created by Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev which uses a convolutional neural network to find and enhance patterns in images via algorithmic pareidolia, thus creating a dream-like hallucinogenic appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.
